# ITU JTEXT

## Description

This project contains two main files: a freq_main_processing.py file and
a model_traning_eval.py file. The processing file is used to preprocess raw data
for model training, while the model training and evaluation file converts the
preprocessed data into a matrix format suitable for training a LightGBM model and
evaluates the performance of the trained model.

## Files

1. `freq_main_processing.py`: This file contains the code for processing the raw
   data. It performs tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and data
   transformation to prepare the data for model training.

2. `model_traning_eval.py`: This file is responsible for training a LightGBM model
   using the preprocessed data. It converts the data into a matrix format that can be
   consumed by the LightGBM library. Additionally, it evaluates the performance of
   the trained model using suitable metrics.

## Folder

1. `util`: this folder contains the processors which are used in
   'freq_main_processing.py'

## Usage

**NOTE:The 2 ipython not books are more readable.**

1. Run the `freq_main_processing.py` script to preprocess the raw data. Make sure
   to provide the necessary input data files or modify the code to fetch the data
   from the appropriate source. The processed data will be stored in a format
   suitable for the model training and evaluation step.

2. Once the data has been processed, run the `model_traning_eval.py` script.
   Ensure that the processed data files are accessible by the script. The script
   will train a LightGBM model using the processed data and output the evaluation
   results, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or any other relevant metrics.
